# Quality Gates

Quality Gates are specific, measurable criteria that a software project must meet at various stages of its development lifecycle before it can proceed to the next stage. They act as automated checkpoints to ensure that all deliverables meet the required standards of quality, security, performance, and compliance.

The primary goal of implementing quality gates is to identify and fix issues early in the development process, reducing risks and costs associated with bugs found later in the cycle or in production.

## Our Quality Gates

Based on our project standards, the following quality gates are enforced automatically in our CI/CD pipeline before any code is merged into the main branch or deployed to production.

| Gate                      | Criteria                                                              | Tooling / Process                                       |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Static Code Analysis** | - No linting errors (ESLint, etc.)<br>- Code is properly formatted. | Automated linting and formatting checks (e.g., Prettier) |
| **2. Security Audit**       | - 0 High/Critical vulnerabilities found.<br>- No exposed secrets/keys. | Static Application Security Testing (SAST) scans.       |
| **3. Unit Test Coverage**   | - Test coverage must be >= 85%.                                       | Code coverage reports (e.g., Jest, Istanbul).           |
| **4. Performance Budget**   | - Bundle size within defined limits.<br>- API response times are acceptable. | Performance monitoring and bundle analysis tools.       |
| **5. Architecture Compliance** | - Code adheres to the defined architectural patterns.                 | Manual review and automated dependency analysis.        |
| **6. Documentation**        | - All new features and APIs are documented.<br>- Documentation is up-to-date. | Manual review during the code review process.           |

### Approval Process

- **Automated Gates (1-4):** These gates are checked automatically on every pull request. A failure in any of these gates will block the merge.
- **Manual Gates (5-6):** These are verified during the mandatory code review process by the Code Review Specialist and other team members.

No pull request will be approved and no code will be deployed unless all quality gates are successfully passed.
